encrypt
=======

PHP-Class to encrypt/decrypt a text (alphanumeric+blank) using a changed variant of the caesar cipher.

Not having used alot of PHP and OOP in PHP before.

The algorithm was made up to the specific problem of creating a changed caesar cipher in which the letters
are not moved by a constant number, but instead, a couple of letters are rearranged depending on a key(word),
the remaining (unused) letters are then added accordingly afterwards.

Class can encrypt and decrypt.


Any suggestions and improvements are very welcome!
